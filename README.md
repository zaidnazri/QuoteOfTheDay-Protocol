# QuoteOfTheDay-Protocol
My ITT440 QotD Protocol Individual Assignment

For this work, i decided on something that is actually fun and simple which is a Quote of the Day protocol for my assignment. I've tried and dawdled with 
SMTP and Finger protocols in the past but i can't get them to work. Then after further studying and researching, i've decided on working on Port 17 which is the 
QOTD Protocol. Most of the socket programming in that is written is based on my lecturer, Sir Azizi's teachings during his class and abit of my personal touches 
in the code that i've made.
